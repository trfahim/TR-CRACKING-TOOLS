# TR CRACKING TOOL ^_^

## Overview
### TR CRACKING TOOL is a Python-based password generation tool designed to assist in brute-force attacks for ethical hacking and security testing. This tool can generate passwords based on names, mobile numbers, and PIN codes ranging from 3 to 8 digits. Additionally, it can generate massive password combinations, including 10 million to 90 million password variations.

## üßø Features

- Generates password lists using:

- Names

- Mobile numbers

- PIN codes (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8-digit combinations)

- Saves generated passwords to a file for future use.

- Built with simplicity and efficiency in mind.

- Uses colorful CLI output for better readability.

## üßø Technologies Used

### ‚û°Ô∏è This project is developed using Python and the following libraries:

- pyfiglet (for banner styling)

- os (for system operations)

- time (for delays and execution control)

- colorama (Fore) (for colored text output)

- Loops (for, if, elif, else) (for logic control)

- Functions (def) (for modular programming)

- File Handling (open, with) (for saving password lists)
